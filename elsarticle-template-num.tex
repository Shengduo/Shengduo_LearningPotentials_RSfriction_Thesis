%% Text of abstract
Rate-and-state friction law has been widely used in the geophysics community for numerical modeling of both dynamic earthquakes and slow slip events happening at geological faults. 
In rate-and-state friction, 
the friction coefficient depends on the both the local slip rate and a state variable, 
whose evolution reflects the slip history of the location. 
Rate-and-state friction law is an empirical law inspired by the behavior of friction coefficient upon sudden change of local slip rate. 
The rate-and-state friction law is able to match the experimentally-measured friction coefficient as slip rate abruptly jumps with four parameters. 
With different configurations of the friction parameters, 
rate-and-state friction can be either rate-strengthening and rate-weakening. 
If friction is rate-weakening, 
then local increase in slip rate will result in a lower steady-state friction coefficient, 
and thus can potentially lead to dynamic earthquakes. 

However, 
as rate-and-state friction is empirically derived, 
it does not come naturally with a potential formulation, 
and thus the solution of a dynamic problem with rate and state friction cannot be formulated as the stationary point of a functional. 
This causes difficulties especially in implicit time discretization of dynamic slipping events. 
In this study, 
we propose a potential formulation of friction law that reproduces rate-and-state frictional behavior, 
to facilitate implicit time discretization of dynamic problems. 
We use Recurrent Neural Operators (RNOs) to model the proposed potentials,  
and show that they can be trained to a high degree of accuracy using standard optimizers with relative $L_p$ loss functions in the framework of PyTorch. 
Finally, 
we verify that the learnt potential formulation indeed facilitates implicit time discretization of dynamic problems.

%%Research highlights
\begin{highlights}
\item \textbf{Potential formulation for rate-and-state friction }: We have shown that there exists a specific potential formulation that accurately approximates the widely-used rate-and-state law of friction. 
We construct the potentials as Recurrent Neural Operators (RNOs), 
and train them on the friction-slip rate sequences generated from the original rate-and-state friction law. 
The trained potentials can reproduce the original rate-and-state friction with a relative $L_2$ error of $2\times10^{-4}$. 

\item \textbf{Rate-and-state fits experiments with $10^{-2}$ error}: Due to limited access to experimental data, 
we have not trained the potentials directly on them. 
Relevant work on fitting rate-and-state friction to experimental data suggests that the best-fitting sequence typically has a relative $L_2$ error of $2\times 10^{-2}$ against experimental data, 
which is two orders of magnitudes higher compared to the fitting error between potential-formulated friction and rate-and-state friction. 
Therefore, 
we expect that the potential formulation will have similar capabilities to capture the rate and state features of experimental data as the original rate-and-state friction law.


\item \textbf{Potential friction facilitates implicit time discretization}: We test whether or not the proposed potential formulation facilitates implicit time discretization of initial value problems.
